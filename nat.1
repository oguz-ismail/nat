.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nat
reads a list from the standard input and columnates it. It accepts the 
following options and no operands:
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIdelimiter\fP
Input items are terminated by the character
.I delimiter
instead of newline. Empty string means NUL.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Input items are separated by white space. Leading and trailing white space are
ignored. This and the option
.B \-d
are mutually exclusive.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIwidth\fP
The output occupies exactly
.I width
character columns. If
.I width
is negative, its absolute value is subtracted from the default value; which is
the width of the terminal the standard error is connected to, the value of the
environment variable \fICOLUMNS\fP, or 80.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIcolumns\fP
The output is arranged in
.I columns
columns. This and the option
.B \-w
are mutually exclusive.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIpadding\fP
Columns are separated by
.I padding
spaces instead of 2.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
Columns are filled across rather than down.
.PP
.RS
The option
.B \-x
is an alias for \fB\-a\fP.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIcolumn\fP[,\fIcolumn\fP]...
The \fIcolumn\fPth column is right-aligned. If
.I column
is followed by a
.I ~
(tilde) and a number \fIN\fP, every \fIN\fPth column following the
\fIcolumn\fPth is also right-aligned. If
.I column
is preceded by a
.I \-
(hyphen), columns are numbered and counted from right to left instead of left
to right. This option can be specified more than once.
.PP
.RS
The option
.B \-n
is an alias for \fB\-r\fP.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-t\fP
The input is already columnated. The delimiter specified using the options
.B \-d
and
.B \-s
separates input columns.
.B nat
replaces each separator with as many spaces as needed to align column contents
and adds padding. If a delimiter is not specified, the tab character is used.
This and the options \fB\-w\fP, \fB\-c\fP, and
.B \-a
are incompatible.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
ANSI color escape sequences found in the input are treated the same way as control characters.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP (capital \fBi\fP)
The default output is supressed, and a single line of space-separated numbers
is printed instead. From left to right, these numbers denote the following:
.PP
.RS
.RS
.PD 0
.IP 1. 3
The number of input items.
.IP 2.
The width of the output.
.IP 3.
The number of output rows.
.IP 4.
The number of output columns.
.IP 5.
The number of character columns that were not used.
.IP 6.
Numbers of right-aligned columns, separated by spaces.
.PD
.RE
.RE
.PP
Each column is as wide as its widest item, and rows are always of equal width.
If the number of columns is not specified and the option
.B \-t
is not used,
.B nat
truncates list items wider than the implied or specified output width.
.PP
Control characters are ignored when calculating the widths of input items, and
.B nat
uses only spaces and newlines for arranging its output.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Other than 0,
.B nat
returns the following exit values:
.TP
1
One or more list items were truncated.
.TP
2
An error occurred.
