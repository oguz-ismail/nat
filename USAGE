nat reads a list from the standard input and columnates it. It takes the
following options:

-d DELIM
	Input items are delimited by DELIM instead of newline.

-w WIDTH
	The output is WIDTH character columns wide. -1 means one less than the
	default value; which is the width of the terminal, the value of the
	environment variable COLUMNS, or 80.

-c COLS
	COLS columns are printed. This and the option -w are mutually exclusive.

-p PADDING
	Columns are separated by PADDING spaces instead of two.

-a
	Columns are filled across rather than down.

If the number of columns is not specified and a list item is wider than the
desired output width, nat returns 1.

Example: displaying the largest packages installed on a Debian system, in
columns:

$ dpkg-query -W -f '${Installed-Size}\t${Package}\n' | sort -nr | cut -f 2 |
> grep -v linux | head | nat -a
aocc-compiler-3.2.0      thunderbird       gcc-12     chromium    cpp-12       
openjdk-11-jre-headless  libreoffice-core  libllvm15  virtualbox  libllvm11
