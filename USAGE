nat reads a list from the standard input and columnates it. It accepts the
following options and no operands:

-d DELIM
	Input items are delimited by the character DELIM instead of newline.

-w WIDTH
	The output occupies exactly WIDTH character columns. -1 means one less
	than the default value; which is the width of the terminal the standard
	error is connected to, the value of the environment variable COLUMNS,
	or 80.

-c COLS
	The output is arranged in COLS columns. This and the option -w are
	mutually exclusive.

-p PADDING
	Columns are separated by PADDING spaces instead of 2.

-a	Columns are filled across rather than down.

Rows are always of equal width. If the number of columns is not specified,
nat truncates list items wider than the implied or specified output width.

Control characters are ignored when calculating the widths of list items, and
nat uses only spaces and newlines for arranging its output.

Other than 0, nat returns the following exit values:

1	One or more list items were truncated.
2	An error occurred.

Example: displaying the largest packages installed on a Debian system, in
columns:

$ dpkg-query -W -f '${Installed-Size}\t${Package}\n' | sort -nr | cut -f 2 |
 grep -v linux | head | nat -a
aocc-compiler-3.2.0      thunderbird       gcc-12     chromium    cpp-12       
openjdk-11-jre-headless  libreoffice-core  libllvm15  virtualbox  libllvm11    
$
