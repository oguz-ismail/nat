nat columnates a list, like ls does with filenames. It reads its input from
standard input, and takes the following options:

-d DELIM
	DELIM delimits input items. Newline by default.

-w WIDTH
	Output is WIDTH spaces wide. Width of the terminal, $COLUMNS, or 80 by
	default. -1 means one less than the default value.

-p PADDING
	Pad columns by PADDING spaces. 2 by default.

nat returns 0 on success, 1 if its input is wider than the implied or specified
width, and 2 on error.

An example:

	$ grep ^rog /usr/share/dict/american-english | nat
	roger    rogering  rogue    roguery's  rogues   roguishly               
	rogered  rogers    roguery  rogue's    roguish
